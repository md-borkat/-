            Most people externalize failure. The economy failed them. Their boss was unfair. Their circumstances were unlucky. But the moment you stop blaming external factors, you reclaim your power. You become the author of your life instead of a character in someone else's story.

    <div class="modal-title">you have to enjoy it</div>
    <div class="modal-text">
        it’s 2025, so yes, we do live on earth — maybe you’re not homo sapiens. We were all born without knowing what was going to happen, where we were going, who we would be raised by, or anything else. A lot of question marks fly around pretty much all the time. It’s like that for everybody. Every single person alive right now has no idea what is going on, and I think taking that personally is a disease. It holds you back from letting go, smiling, and walking around like, who cares? Nobody cares. Believe me — nobody does. Maybe you think some people care about you, but they actually don’t. The truth is, they don’t have bigger problems than you; that’s why they give you some initial company. Don’t ever think they will save you. If you do, most chances are you will get destroyed pretty soon.
        <br><br>
        The piece of advice I have is to have a little bit more fun. Think of it like an exercise — just to warm yourself up to enjoying life and not taking things too seriously. For example: talk to strangers. If you’re walking on the sidewalk and someone is coming toward you, don’t just look at the ground and awkwardly walk past them. Look at them in the eyes and say, “Hey, how’s your day?” Anything is fine — who cares? If you’re at the park and someone is sitting on a bench, say “What’s up?” Nobody knows what’s going on. Everybody is just walking around doing whatever.
        <br><br>
        Like, what is his job? How much does he make yearly? It’s all just ideas floating around. You can make your life a little more fun by going up to random people. It will be hard at first, but you’ll get used to it. Eventually you’ll realize: oh yeah, nobody actually cares.
        <br><br>
        And don’t forget — that was just an example. You get one life. Working five days a week for two days of fun? Exactly. Maybe you meet one person who has the information you’ve been searching for for years. It’s free to access — you just have to ask questions. Where did you grow up? What did you do? What do you like doing? What do you know? Any book recommendations?
        <br><br>
        Maybe the whole advice sounds foolish, but finally: don’t use someone else’s map to find your own road. You’ve got only one life. Live it the way you think is good.

    <div class="modal-title">When You Truly Work for Yourself</div>
    <div class="modal-text">
      The shift from employment to self-employment is more than financial. It rewires how you think about time, risk, and responsibility. When you work for yourself, there is no one to blame for failure except yourself. This clarity is both terrifying and liberating.
      <br><br>
      You become acutely aware of every decision's consequences. There is no safety net of a paycheck arriving regardless of performance. Your income is directly tied to the value you create and the decisions you make. This forces a level of intentionality that employment rarely demands.
      <br><br>
      But there is something deeper. When you work for yourself, you stop being a cog in a machine. You are no longer optimizing for someone else's vision or quarterly targets. You can build something that matters to you. The work itself becomes different when you own it completely.

      Most people externalize failure. The economy failed them. Their boss was unfair. Their circumstances were unlucky. But the moment you stop blaming external factors, you reclaim your power. You become the author of your life instead of a character in someone else's story.
      <br><br>
      This is not about self-blame in the destructive sense. It is about taking radical responsibility. Even when circumstances are genuinely difficult, there are still choices. You can choose how to respond, what to learn, where to pivot. This agency is the most valuable thing you possess.
      <br><br>
      People who blame themselves for failures are often the most successful because they believe they can change the outcome next time. They do not wait for permission or for conditions to improve. They move. And most importantly, they learn faster than anyone else.

      <br><br>
      Consider a great user interface. Every pixel, every interaction, every animation is calibrated. It is not that each element is individually brilliant. It is that they work together. Remove one part and the whole collapses. Add something new and it disrupts the harmony.
      <br><br>
      This principle extends beyond products to ideas, businesses, and systems. The ones that work have achieved a kind of equilibrium. They are robust not because they are perfect, but because they are integrated. They work together.

      <br><br>
      Want to be creative? Do not stare at a blank page willing ideas into existence. Work on something else, go for a walk, read, rest. Creativity emerges in the margins. Want to be healthy? Do not obsess over health. Build a life where movement and good food are natural. Want to be happy? Do not chase happiness. Pursue meaningful work, deep relationships, and useful challenges.
      <br><br>
      The best things in life seem to work this way. They require you to look sideways, to approach from an angle you did not expect. This is why wisdom often sounds paradoxical. It is because the direct path and the true path are often different things entirely.
