    <div class="modal-title">you have to enjoy it</div>
    <div class="modal-text">
        borkat:it’s 2025, so yes, we do live on earth — maybe you’re not homo sapiens. we were all born without knowing what was going to happen, where we were going, who we would be raised by, or anything else. a lot of question marks fly around pretty much all the time. it’s like that for everybody. every single person alive right now has no idea what is going on, and I think taking that personally is a disease. it holds you back from letting go, smiling, and walking around like, who cares? nobody cares. believe me — nobody does. maybe you think some people care about you, but they actually don’t. the truth is, they don’t have bigger problems than you; that’s why they give you some initial company. don’t ever think they will save you. if you do, most chances are you will get destroyed pretty soon.
        <br><br>
        the piece of advice i have is to have a little bit more fun. think of it like an exercise — just to warm yourself up to enjoying life and not taking things too seriously. for example: talk to strangers. if you’re walking on the sidewalk and someone is coming toward you, don’t just look at the ground and awkwardly walk past them. look at them in the eyes and say, “hey, how’s your day?” anything is fine — who cares? if you’re at the park and someone is sitting on a bench, say “what’s up?” nobody knows what’s going on. everybody is just walking around doing whatever.
        <br><br>
        like, what is his job? how much does he make yearly? it’s all just ideas floating around. you can make your life a little more fun by going up to random people. it will be hard at first, but you’ll get used to it. eventually you’ll realize: oh yeah, nobody actually cares.
        <br><br>
        and don’t forget — that was just an example. you get one life. working five days a week for two days of fun? exactly. maybe you meet one person who has the information you’ve been searching for for years. it’s free to access — you just have to ask questions. where did you grow up? What did you do? What do you like doing? What do you know? any book recommendations?
        <br><br>
        maybe the whole advice sounds foolish, but finally: don’t use someone else’s map to find your own road. you’ve got only one life. live it the way you think is good.

      <br><br>
      recently, i was watching an interview of nvidia’s ceo jensen huang where he said, “i work as much as i can from the moment i wake up until the moment i go to bed. i work seven days a week. when i’m not working, i’m thinking about working.” do you think it’s possible for an individual to do that if he doesn’t love his work? it’s never possible.
      <br><br>
      there are basically three big decisions you make around that age, and one of them is what you are doing. at the end of the day, life is really a single-player game. it’s all going on in your head. whatever you think and believe will very much shape your reality. if you are walking down the street and judging everyone—like “i don’t like them because of their skin color,” “she’s not attractive,” “that guy is fat,” “this person is a loser,” “who put this in my way”—the more you judge, the more you separate yourself. you will feel good for an instant because you feel superior, but then you will feel lonely. you’re just going to see negativity everywhere. the world just reflects your own feelings back at you.
      <br><br>
      reality is neutral. reality has no judgments. you are born, you experience a whole set of sensations—lights, colors, sounds—and then you die. how you choose to interpret all of that is up to you.

      <br><br>
      This is not about self-blame in the destructive sense. It is about taking radical responsibility. Even when circumstances are genuinely difficult, there are still choices. You can choose how to respond, what to learn, where to pivot. This agency is the most valuable thing you possess.
      <br><br>
      People who blame themselves for failures are often the most successful because they believe they can change the outcome next time. They do not wait for permission or for conditions to improve. They move. And most importantly, they learn faster than anyone else.

      borkat:this is one of the most debated dimensions of human existence: should you simply drift with the current, or should you challenge the direction it pushes you toward? is the so-called “main life goal” really what society insists it must be? and, more importantly, what do we genuinely require to feel fulfilled?

if you can fully inhabit the present moment, do you truly need anything that fails to enrich your sense of meaning? perhaps those things hold some value, but not enough to outweigh the importance of being alive and aware. every human carries a soul, and we naturally gravitate toward the actions we love—whether or not they appear purposeful to others.

and here’s the real question: if a person feels content working a minimum-wage job, who has the authority to stop them? if someone is at peace even in unemployment and genuinely loves their life, does the judgment of others hold any real weight?
      <br><br>
      do you honestly believe that, in 2026, a degree is the only gateway to your dream career? if your answer is yes, then perhaps we’re not aligned. most of the knowledge, tools, and opportunities you need are now only a single intelligent search away.

ultimately, if you remain faithful to your own path and it leads you toward the life you once imagined, then that achievement is enough. i’m writing this for one simple purpose: to remind you that happiness matters more than any external measure of success. if you’re content with the life you choose, that alone justifies your journey.
      <br><br>
      and remember this: there is no second life—not here, not in any alternate universe. so why waste the one you have? i’m not suggesting you surrender to every intrusive impulse. make choices that are rational and meaningful. take your time with major decisions. be kind to others and offer help where you can. remove the people who lead you nowhere—they are distractions, not companions.

live a grounded life: pursue what aligns with your talent, your belief, and your love. anything else will pull you off your path and ultimately damage you. don’t become that person.

and never forget: once you’re gone, people will shape your story however they choose. before you make any life-changing decision, pause, reflect, and choose yourself first.

can you increase happiness without losing your drive? 

        it’s ok to not want to be happy. but we’re going to explore whether you can increase your happiness without significantly lowering your drive or intellect.
      <br><br>
      figuring out the truth will lead to happiness
but don’t get it backwards: you’re not smart because you’re unhappy; you’re unhappy because you’re smart. you can be happy and smart—it’s just going to take more work. the good news is, smart people are good at figuring out the truth. the more you dig into certain deep truths, the freer and more peaceful you will become. that peace will lead to happiness.

        if you’re so smart, why aren’t you happy? i absolutely believe that is true. the beauty of being mentally high functioning in our society is that you can trade it for almost anything. 

        if you’re smart, you can figure out how to be happy within your biological constraints. but your biological constraints are a lot larger than you might think.
      <br><br>
      of course, some of this is a fake, pleasure-driven happiness. but there’s truth to it; otherwise, you wouldn’t desire that state.
